# üå± Custom Unity Framework

This project started from a desire to build a **solid and reusable technical foundation**.  

Instead of making small prototypes or unfinished game ideas, I decided to **tackle things from the ground up**: building a clean, scalable, ready-to-use base for all my future Unity projects.

> **Currently using Unity 6** (6000.0.41f1)

## üîç What I'm trying to learn / improve

- Deepen my knowledge of **Unity's ecosystem** (Input System, Custom graphics settings, SRP, APIs, Event Dispatching...)
- Create a **smooth and clean development flow** (Scene Bootstrapping, Dynamic Settings UI, Persistent Save System...)
- Improve my **system design thinking** before jumping into gameplay
- Build good habits for **clean code, documentation, and maintainability**

## üìå TODO

- [ ] Finish `GraphicsSettings` logic
- [ ] Final polish on the `SettingsMenu`
- [ ] Internal documentation

### üîß Some tools developed as part of, or inspired by this framework:

- [MaskMapWizard](https://github.com/cfrBernard/MaskMapWizard) ‚Äì A standalone Python tool to combine texture maps into Unity-compatible Mask Maps.
